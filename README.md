Project : Raspberry Pi Super Computer

The objective of the project is to build a cluster of Raspberry Pi cluster to use it for different purposes where huge computational power is needed for a specific task.

- This project can be used as a supercomputer for engineering simulations where computational power is higher than normal computer.
- This can also be used as a server by individuals to test websites.
-  Algorithms developed to increase server efficiency and Server security can be tested in this Self made Raspberry Pi server.
